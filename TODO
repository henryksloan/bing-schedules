Course container input:
  ☐ Fix Tab

User schedules:
  ☐ Multiple schedules
  Events rework:
    ☐ Allow repeated or singular custom events
    ☐ Create different default and custom types (course, club, custom, other)
    ☐ Integrate these changes into the schedule editor
    ☐ Think about what distinctions should be made between different subsets of schedule, e.g. courses, courses+clubs, etc
      Groups should be able to control what event types are allowed
      Therefore, it should be easy to change the type of an event
    ☐ When creating new schedules, users should be able to duplicate all or some of the categories (e.g. courses) from old schedules

Group settings:
  ☐ Creating a group should send the user to the group page
  ☐ Verify how "members can view schedules" works
  ☐ Allow control over event types allowed

Adding people to groups:
  ☐ Link sharing
    Anyone with link can ___
  ☐ Codes like jackbox or kahoot
  ☐ Add by email with optional email notification and message

Responsive Design and Usability:
  ☐ Consider combining my groups and create a group
    Maybe just for small screens, but perhaps also in general to be consistent
    Would probably be best to create a popup for group creation settings
    In that case, there should be a plus FAB or inline new group button entry
